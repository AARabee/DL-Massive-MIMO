# Feedfroward Network for Channel Mapping
The available codes help generate the second figure in the paper "Deep Learning for TDD and FDD Massive MIMO:
Mapping Channels in Space and Frequency", submitted for publication at Asilomar 2019.

# Requirements
To generate all the results and more, the dataset should be generated using the [DeepMIMO dataset](http://www.deepmimo.net). The settings are mentioned in the experiemental results section of the paper above.
