# Feedfroward Network for Channel Mapping
The available codes help generate the second figure in the paper "Deep Learning for TDD and FDD Massive MIMO:
Mapping Channels in Space and Frequency", submitted for publication at Asilomar 2019.

# Requirements
To generate all the results and more, the dataset should be generated using the [DeepMIMO dataset](http://www.deepmimo.net). The settings are mentioned in the experiemental results section of the paper above and listed down here:

    Name of scenario & Ind\_1\_2.4GHz and Ind\_1\_2.5GHz \\
    \hline
    Number of BSs & 64 \\
    \hline
    Active users & Row 1 to 502 \\
    \hline
    Number of BS antennas in (x, y, x)  & (1,1,1) \\
    \hline
    System BW & 0.02 GHz\\
    \hline
    Number of OFDM sub-carriers & 64\\
    \hline
    OFDM sampling factor & 1 \\
    \hline
    OFDM limit & 16\\
